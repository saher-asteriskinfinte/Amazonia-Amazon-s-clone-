# 🛒 Amazon Clone

A simple **Amazon homepage clone** created using **HTML and CSS only**.  
This project focuses on replicating Amazon’s basic layout and design structure — built purely for learning front-end fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was made to practice:
- HTML structure and semantic tags  
- CSS styling and layout (Flexbox, positioning, etc.)  
- Building a real-world website clone from scratch  

It’s **not responsive** and does **not include JavaScript** — it’s focused entirely on learning and improving HTML/CSS design skills.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – for structure and content  
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout
